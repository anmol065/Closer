# Closer
This project is a front-end clone of a web-based video conferencing platform called Closer. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and makes use of popular libraries and frameworks like Bootstrap, FontAwesome and Google fonts for visual design and easy navigation. 
The navigation includes a "New Meeting" button, which allows users to initiate a new video call. The project is open-source and can be modified to suit different use-cases. You can access the live version of the project by visiting this link: https://anmol065.github.io/CLOSER/
